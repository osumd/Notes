The network core

Bandwidth, bits/s

circuit-switching: dedicated circuit per call: telephone nets

packet-switching: data sent thru net in discrete "chuncks"

busy signal: no resources available.

reserved path, reserved resources:
no sharing: interference between bits
tower, radio to line? to radio?

fdm tdm

time division mulitple axis
frequency division multiple axis
bandwidth division tactic, either divide by frequency or by time

1gbps = 10^9bps
1mbps = 10^6bps
1kbps = 10^3bps


Packet switching
statistical multiplexing
R = 100Mb/s
R = 1.5Mb/s
queue of packets, waiting for output link

On demand packet scheme in packet switching.
destination address arriving in packet's header.
