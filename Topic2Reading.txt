probability: proportion of times the outcome would occur
Law of Large Numbers: probability over large sample size converge to probabilistic value 1/n
Disjoint outcomes: outcomes which cannot happen at the same time.
Addition Rule: Probability of either disjoint outcomes happening, then P(1) + P(2), where P is probability of x

Non Disjoint
GeneralAdditionRule P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

P(A and B) = Intersection of values in non disjoint set divided by N

Probability Distribution,
Table of probabilities based on different sets of outcomes
sample Space Set of All outcomes
Complement - Set of all outcomes in sample space that inside current set.

Independent: Outcome of one event does not influence the outcome of another event.
Multiplication Rule For Independent Processses
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)...
