Unit Test:
	Test single functionality of a wider program, in which the contents including global variables are
	are not effected by the unity test.
	
	Global variables being changed in one unit test can effect the behaviour of other modules
	within the code space.
Problem with naive implementation of unit test:
	If one error fails before all other unit test scenarios are run, then it is bad.

	

Unit testing framework.
	Java Script Testing Framework.
		npm install --save-dev jest
			: save -dev says : i want to install this package locally withi n my node_modules
			folders, specifically within a development sub module and only a dependency durring
			development
	Inversion Of Control:
		You give it your code and it will execute your ode with in some larger context.

		Use jest to run our code, jest commands are seemmlessly in mvm,
		Set up npm test commands to implement

		Package.json
		Set scripts: "test": "jest"

	Jest unit tests.
		option 1: file in driectory __tests__, anywhere in proejcts make it.
			the test directory could be in the top or sub directory.

		option 2: or file name says something.test.js and npm test will locate this and execute this file.
			
		use function test('test_description', function(*test_itself) )		: test now.
		
		assertions in jest:
			expect("input value").toBe("expected value").
		
	Assignment.
		Write a list of alot of unit tests.
