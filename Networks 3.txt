Packet lengt = L bits
trans, rate R = 1Mbps
distance = 1km, speed = 2x10^m/s

Question: which bit is being transmitted at the time the first bit arrives at Host B

	(L/1Mbps) assumed 1 bit takes 1 microseconds to send.
	(1000m/2x10^m/s) = 5 microsecond,
	
then after the 6th bit, finally the 1st bit arrives and the 7th bit is about to be sent.


Excersize 3
arrival rate = 64kbps, 6400/1000000 = mbps 
trans.rate R = 1Mbps,
delay_prop = 2msec

if group packet is 48 Bytes
transmission delay: 48*8 bits / 74 * 1000 bps


HostA:
	converts analog to digital at a =64kbps
	group bits into L=48Byte packets
	sends packet to Host B as soon it gathers a packet

HostB:
	s soon as it recieves the whole pakcet it converts it to analog.

How much time elapses from when 1st bit of 1st packet is created until
the last bit of the 1st packet arrives at Host B

transmission delay + propogation delay, per bit


queuing delay and packet loss
queueing and loss:
if arrival rate exceeds link's transmission rate, then there will be:
	Delay: packets will queue, wait to be transmissed on link
	Loss: packets can be dropped if memory (buffer) fills up
eg. if the propogation or transmission time is slower than the arrival of bits

Queueing delay ( more insights)
a = arrival rate eg 48kbs
Packet arrival rate = a packets/sec
Packet length = L bits , 
Link bandwidth = R bits/sec
Every second: aL bits arrive to queue | arrival rate
Every second: R bits leave the router

stable system aL < R
or unstable system

P = aL/R is called traffic intensity
should be less than 1

N packets every T seconds
packets per second N/T

arrival rate a = 1/(L/R) = R/L (packets/seconds)
Traffic intensity = aL/R = (R/L)(L/R) = 1
average queueing delay = 0 when 1 because arrival rate is same as transmission rate
and don't need to be queued

((R/L)*i(L/R)*i) - i

if
N packet arrive simulatenous every LN/R,
then a = N/(LN/R) = R/L
Traffic intensity = aL/R = (R/L)(L/R) = 1

Store and forward

distance=  d m; sped of propagation = s m/sec

transmission rate of link = R bits/s

delay (one packet only) to simply transmit
= L/R + d/s 

2L/R

Store and Forward (impace of queueing delay)
	different rates 
		R1 and R2 bit/s
	consider sending 2 packets A and B size L
Two cases:
	Case 1: R1 < R2: no queuing delay
		L/R1 > L/R2, then transmission delay
		from router 1 to router 2 is greater.
		because transmission speed is less.
	Case 2: R1 > R2: ther is queuing delay.
		L/R2 > L/R1
		then queueing delay is
		L/R2 - L/R1

Throughput:
	througput: rate (bits/time unit) of bit transferred between sender and
	receiver
		instantaneous: rate at given point in time
		average: rate over longer period of time
